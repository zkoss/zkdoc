There are several ways to extend ZUML:

1.  Add additional languages (aka., component sets)
2.  Add more implicit objects by the use of [variable resolvers](zuml_ref/variable-resolver)
3.  Add more functions by the use of [function mappers](zuml_ref/function-mapper)
    or
    [xel-method](zuml_ref/xel-method)

This chapter describes additional interpreters, such as Groovy, and
additional EL evaluators, such as MVEL.
