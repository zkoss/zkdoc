There are several ways to extend ZUML:

1.  Add additional languages (aka., component sets)
2.  Add more implicit objects by the use of [variable resolvers](/zuml_ref/variable_resolver)
3.  Add more functions by the use of [function mappers](/zuml_ref/function_mapper)
    or
    [xel-method](/zuml_ref/xel_method)

This chapter describes additional interpreters, such as Groovy, and
additional EL evaluators, such as MVEL.
