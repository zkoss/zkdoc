**Syntax:**

<?function-mapper class="..." 
   [''arg0''="..."] [''arg1''="..."] [''arg2''="..."] [''arg3''="..."]?>

Specifies the function mapper that will be used by the EL expressions to
resolve unknown functions. The specified class must implement the
<javadoc type="interface">org.zkoss.xel.FunctionMapper</javadoc>
interface.

You can specify multiple variable resolvers with multiple
`function-mapper` directives. The later declared one that has higher
priority.

Notice that the `function-mapper` directives are evaluated before the
`init` directives.

## class

`[Optional]`

A class name must implement the
<javadoc type="interface">org.zkoss.xel.FunctionMapper</javadoc>
interface. Unlike the `init` directive, the class name cannot be the
class that is defined in zscript codes.

## arg0, arg1...

`[Optional]`

You could specify any number of arguments. If not specified, the default
constructor is assumed. If specified, it will look for the constructor
with the signature in the following order:

1.  Foo(Map args)
2.  Foo(Object\[\] args)
3.  Foo()

If the first signature is found, the arguments with the name and value
are passed to the constructor as an instance of `Map`. If the second
signature is found, the values of arguments are passed to the
constructor as an array of objects. For example,

``` xml
<?function-mapper class="foo.Foo" whatever="anything"?>
```

Prior to ZK 3.6.2, only the second signature is checked if one or more
argument is specified, and it assumes `arg0` as the first argument,
`arg1` as the second, and so on.
