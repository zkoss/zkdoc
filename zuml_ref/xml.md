XML component sets. It is used to generate (static) XML document, such
as [RSS feed](http://www.whatisrss.com/). For introduction please refer

Most of XML elements with the XML namespace are mapped to a general XML
component ([org.zkoss.zml.XmlNativeComponent](https://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/zml/XmlNativeComponent.html)) that
will generate the element and all its attributes to the client directly.

However, the XML component set also provide some components for
different functionality. For more information please refer to [ZK Component Reference]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_component_ref/xml_components).
