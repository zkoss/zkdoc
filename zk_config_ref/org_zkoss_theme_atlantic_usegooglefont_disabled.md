**Property:** org.zkoss.theme.atlantic.useGoogleFont.disabled

`Default:Â `*`false`*

By default Atlantic theme imports Google font, but some countries (e.g.
China) are blocked from accessing that font or there is no internet
available for a ZK-based application. Then this blocking will cause the
theme displaying incorrectly. In this case, you need to disable
importing Google font by the library property in zk.xml
