**Syntax:**

<au-writer-class>a_class_name</au-writer-class>

`[Default: `org.zkoss.zk.au.http.HttpAuWriter` for ZK CE and PE, or `org.zkoss.zkmax.au.http.SmartAuWriter` for ZK EE]`

It specifies which class is used to implement the AU writer. The AU
writer is used to generate the output and send it to the client. The
class must have a default constructor (without any argument), and
implement the
<javadoc type="interface">org.zkoss.zk.au.AuWriter</javadoc> interface.

There are two built-in implementations, `HttpAuWriter` and
`SmartAuWriter`. The former one sends the output the client after the
requests are processed completely. On the other hand, the later one will
send a partial output first if the processing is taking too long (half
of the value specified in the `resend-delay` element). By sending the
partial output, the client will know if the server is still alive.
