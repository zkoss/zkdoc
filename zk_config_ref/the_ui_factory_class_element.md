**Syntax:**

```xml
<ui-factory-class>a_class_name</ui-factory-class>
```

[Default: `org.zkoss.zk.ui.http.SimpleUiFactory`]

It specifies which class is used to create desktops and pages, and to
convert URL to a page definition. The class must have a default
constructor (without any argument), and implement the
[org.zkoss.zk.ui.sys.UiFactory](https://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/zk/ui/sys/UiFactory.html)
interface.

One instance of the UI factory is created and shared for each Web
application, so you have to synchronize the access properly.

A common use is to load page definitions and other UI information from
the database, rather than from the resources of the Web application.

In addition, you might use it to implement a controller in a MVC model,
such that it creates the correct desktop based on the request URL.

Available implementations are as follows.

| Class | Description |
|:-----:|:------------|
| `org.zkoss.zk.ui.http.SimpleUiFactory` | The default UI factory. The sessions generated by this factory is *not* serializable |
| `org.zkoss.zk.ui.http.SerializableUiFactory` | The sessions generated by this factory is serializable. If you want to store sessions when the Web server is shutdown and restore them after it started, you can specify this implementation. |
