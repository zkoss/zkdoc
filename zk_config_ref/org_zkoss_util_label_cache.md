**Property:**

`org.zkoss.util.label.cache`

`Default: `<i>`true`</i>

Specifies whether to cache zk-labels.properties. By default, it is
enabled. It means the content of zk-labels.properties is loaded and
cached at the server. If you are developing a ZK application and you'd
like to modify zk-labels.properties without restarting the server, you
could disable it.

Please refer to [ZK Developer's Reference:
Internationalization]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_dev_ref/internationalization/labels)
for more information about zk-label.properties.
