**Property:**

`org.zkoss.zk.ui.uuidRecycle.disabled `
{% include global-scope-only.html %}
Default:  `false` (i.e., UUID recycle is enabled)
{% include supported-since.html version="5.0.3" %}
It specifies whether to disable the recycling of UUID. By recycling UUID it will reduce the memory use of the browser. It is enabled by default.
UUID in ZK refers to DOM element id which is generated by ZK framework for each js widget. When a widget is removed, its UUID can be reused for a new widget. This can help reduce memory usage in the browser. But it might affect automated testing tools or other scenarios where unique UUIDs are expected for each widget.

{% include supported-since.html version="9.6.1" %}
Show the warning below when starting a server to recommend disabling this feature. (i.e. specifying with `true`)

`UUID recycle is enabled and it's better to disable it by specifying a library property 'org.zkoss.zk.ui.uuidRecycle.disabled' with true to prevent some unwanted widget uuid reusing at client side accidentally.`

{% include DeprecatedSince.md version="10.0.0" %}
Never recycle UUID.
