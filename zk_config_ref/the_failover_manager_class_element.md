**Syntax:**

```xml
<failover-manager-class>a_class_name</failover-manager-class>
```

`[Default:Â `none`]`

It specifies which class should be used to handle the failover. This is
called to recover a desktop, when ZK cannot locate the desktop. The
class must have a default constructor (without any argument), and
implement the
[org.zkoss.zk.ui.sys.FailoverManager](https://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/zk/ui/sys/FailoverManager.html)
interface.

In most cases, you don't need to provide any implementation. Rather, you
can let Web servers to handle failover and clustering for you by
specifying the
`org.zkoss.zk.ui.http.SerializableUiFactory` class in
the `ui-factory-class` element as described above.
