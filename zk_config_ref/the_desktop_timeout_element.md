**Syntax:**

<desktop-timeout>*`a_number`*</desktop-timeout>

`[Default:Â 3600]`

It specifies the time, in **seconds**, between client requests before a
desktop is invalidated. A negative time indicates the desktop should
never timeout.

In 9.x and before, it only works when the current desktop count exceeds
`max-desktops-per-session` and while adding a new desktop (both
conditions should match).

It works regardless of the current desktop count.
