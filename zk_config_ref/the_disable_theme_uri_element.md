**Syntax:**

<disable-theme-uri>*`a_theme_uri`*</disable-theme-uri>

`[Default:Â `*`none`*`]`

It specifies what theme URI needs to be disabled. The URI should be one
of the URIs generated by the current theme. For example, the following
statement disables the generation of the URIs of the default theme
(since it has only one URI: `~./zul/css/zk.wcs`).

``` xml
 <desktop-config>
     <disable-theme-uri>~./zul/css/zk.wcs</disable-theme-uri>
 </desktop-config>
```

You rarely need it. Rather, implementing [a theme
provider](ZK_Developer's_Reference/Theming_and_Styling/Theme_Providers)
is a more controllable alternative.

It is usually used with the `theme-uri` element to replace the default
theme. Please refer to [ZK Developer's
Reference](ZK_Developer's_Reference/Theming_and_Styling/Theme_Customization)
for more details about theming and styling.
