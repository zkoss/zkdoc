# Configure Keyboard Shortcuts

Many keyboard shortcuts are configurable via **Preference** window
(click **\[Windows\]/\[Preferences\]** in Eclipse main menu); the
preference page to configure keyboard shortcuts (or so called "hotkey")
is located in **General/Keys** preference page.

You can refer to the ["*Customizing Key bindings*" section of Eclipse official help](http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/accessibility/keyboardshortcuts.htm).

# Add Source Code and Javadoc Resource to JAR File

## Set Source for JAR File

You can attach a source archive (another JAR file which include the
source code) or source folder to a library. Eclipse will then use this
resource to show the source instead of a the decompiled code. Setting
the source attachment also allows source level stepping with the
debugger.

please refer to Eclipse help:

The source JAR files of ZK Package is under the dist/src folder in the
already extracted ZK package.
