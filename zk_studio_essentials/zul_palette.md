In addition to directly typing tags in the ZUL Editor, ZUL Palette
provides a drag-and-drop feature to insert components. You can open the
ZUL palette by going to **\[Window\]/\[Show View\]/\[Others\]**, and
selecting **ZK / ZUL Palette**.

# Drag & Drop Support

You can select a component in the ZUL Palette and drag it into the ZUL
Editor. When you drop that component into a proper place, it will insert
corresponding tag into that location in the ZUL. You can also drag an
item into outline view of a zul, ZK Studio will insert the component tag
into the mapping position of the ZUL and the outline view will change
accordingly.

# Name Filtering

The ZUL Palette supports ZUML tag name filtering. Upon typing a
component's name into the filter text box to search, the palette will
filter listed components automatically.
