The Outline view presents a tree structure view of the content in the
currently selected ZUL Editor. It can be opened by clicking
**\[Window\]/\[Show View\]/\[Outline\]**. Through this view, you can
quickly get a big picture of the components you have used in a ZUL.

Each component in this view is prefixed with an icon to distinguish
different tag elements. Any modification made to the zul file will be
updated in the tree content in the Outline view instantly. You can also
drag a component item in the ZUL Palette into this view to insert a
component.
