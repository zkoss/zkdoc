The Properties view is a tabulated view which lists applicable
attributes and its values of a component that you have selected in the
Outline view or of a component you have put the cursor on in the ZUL
Editor. You can open it by clicking **\[Window\]/\[Show
View\]/\[Properties\]**.

<div style='text-align:center'>

**Properties of a Window**

</div>

Using the properties grid you are able to edit the value directly. For
some properties with enumeration value (e.g. true/false, normal/none,
left/center/right), an informative combo box editor is used to help you
input the correct value.
