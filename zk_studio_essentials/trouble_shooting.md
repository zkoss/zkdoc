# Activation

Don't mess around your system time. It may cause license check fail.

ZK studio uses **user.home** folder as the default location to store
system level information such as the welcome page and license related
files. Now you can use the environment variable **ZK_STUDIO_HOME** to
set up the location where you like to store such information.
