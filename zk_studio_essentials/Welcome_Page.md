The Welcome Page aims to provide useful links for new ZK developers. The
page is a web page and is automatically updated by the ZK Studio server.
The page's hyperlinks consist of two types:

- **Action**: An action link will start a predefined ZK Studio task,
  such as **Create New Project...**
- **Webpage**: A web page link will take users to visit online
  documentation or community.

The Welcome Page can be opened by clicking **\[Help\]/\[ZK Help\]/\[ZK
Welcome Page\]**
