- Java API: [org.zkoss.zul.NoDOM](https://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/zul/NoDOM.html)
- JavaScript API: [zul.wgt.Nodom](https://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/jsdoc/classes/zul.wgt.Nodom.html)

## Employment/Purpose

The `Nodom` component in ZK is a server-side Java object that does not render any DOM elements or JavaScript widgets at the client-side. Instead, it renders comment nodes for positioning. This makes it ideal for controlling a group of components without introducing unnecessary DOM elements. You can use the `Nodom` component as the outermost container to group components under a controller (such as a composer or ViewModel) instead of using a `Window` or a `Div`.

## Limitations
- The `Nodom` component does not support using `hflex` or `vflex` properties within itself and its children components.

## Example

![Nodom Example](images/ZKComRef_Idspace_Example.png)

In the following example, the `Nodom` component is used as the outermost container to group components under a ViewModel. The example includes a `button` component inside a `window` and another `button` component inside a `div`.

```xml
<nodom viewModel="@id('vm')@init('foo.MyViewModel')">
	<window border="normal">
		<button id="btn" label="@init(vm.label)" />
	</window>
	<div>
		<button id="btn" label="@init(vm.label)" />
	</div>
</nodom>
```

```java
public class MyViewModel {

  public String getLabel() {
		return "button";
  }
}
```

## Supported Children

`*ALL`: Indicates that the `Nodom` component can have any kind of ZK component as its child element. This allows you to include any ZK component within the `Nodom`, providing flexibility and customization options for your designs.
