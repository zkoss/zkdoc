This section describes how to use the [XML component
set](ZUML_Reference/ZUML/Languages/XML). The XML component
set is a special [component
set](ZUML_Reference/ZUML/Languages) used in a XML device. A
XML device is a client that accepts XML output. You can *not* use it
with [ZUL](ZUML_Reference/ZUML/Languages/ZUL) or
[XHTML](ZUML_Reference/ZUML/Languages/XHTML).

For introduction please refer to [ZK Developer's
Reference](ZK_Developer's_Reference/UI_Patterns/XML_Ouput).

Most of XML elements with the XML namespace are mapped to a general XML
component (<javadoc>org.zkoss.zml.XmlNativeComponent</javadoc>) that
will generate the element and all its attributes to the client directly.
However, the XML component set also provide some components for
different functionality. We discuss them one-by-one in the following
sections.
