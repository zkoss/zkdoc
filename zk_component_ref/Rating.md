# Employment/Purpose

The rating component is a component that allows users to select a rating
value that is smaller than the maximum number.

It is ideal for various applications, including e-commerce platforms
where customers can rate products to share their satisfaction, and media
sites where users can evaluate movies or articles. It is also useful for
students to provide feedback on courses and instructors in educational
environments. Additionally, social media platforms can utilize the
Rating component to allow users to express opinions on posts, enhancing
engagement. Overall, it serves as a versatile tool for collecting user
feedback across different domains.
