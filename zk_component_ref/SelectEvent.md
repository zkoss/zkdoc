SelectEvents. For example, if you're using a listbox and want to detect
if the CTRL key is being held when one of the listitems is selected.

``` xml
<zk>
    <label id="i"/>
    <listbox onSelect='i.value = "keys: "+event.getKeys()'>
        <listhead>
            <listheader label="Population"/>
            <listheader label="%"/>
        </listhead>
        <listitem value="A">
            <listcell>a</listcell>
            <listcell label="20%"/>
        </listitem>
        <listitem value="B">
            <listcell>b</listcell>
            <listcell>c</listcell>
        </listitem>
    </listbox>

## Get the Previous Selected Items

If users want to know which of the selected items are newly added or
removed, they can use the *getPreviousSelectedItems* method to filter
out. (if a model exists and is in paging mold, it should return null)

## Get the Previous Selected Objects

{% include version-badge.html version=7.0.1 %} If users want to know which of the
selected objects are new added or removed, they can use the
*getPreviousSelectedObjects* method to filter out. The information is
available only when the target component has a model.

## Get the Unselected Items

{% include version-badge.html version=7.0.1 %} If users want to know which of the
selected items are deselected, they can use the *getUnselectedItems*
method to filter out. (if a model exists and is in paging mold, it
should return null)

## Get the Unselected Objects

{% include version-badge.html version=7.0.1 %} If users want to know which of the
selected objects are deselected, they can use the *getUnselectedObjects*
method to filter out. The information is available only when the target
component has a model.
