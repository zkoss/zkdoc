title: "ZK Component Reference"
---



This guide acts as a reference of components. We outline each of the XUL
components and include discussions of XHTML and XML components.

> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
>
> - For introductory concepts, please refer to [ZK Developer's > Reference: UI > Composing]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_dev_ref/ui_composing/ui_composing).
> - For general operations, such as drag-and-drop, hflex/vflex, tooltips
>   and context menus, please refer to [ZK Developer's Reference: UI > Patterns]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_dev_ref/ui_patterns/ui_patterns).

The guide follows a distinctive pattern outlining the following items:

- A link to a demonstration of the component
- A link to the component's Java API
- A link to the component's JavaScript API
- The employment and purpose of the component
- An example with source of the component
- The component's supported events and children
- Component's use cases
- The version history of the component
