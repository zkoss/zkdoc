# Abstract Component

- **Java API**: [org.zkoss.zk.ui.AbstractComponent](https://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/zk/ui/AbstractComponent.html)

## Employment/Purpose
The AbstractComponent class in ZK serves as a foundation for creating custom components by extending its functionality. By extending AbstractComponent, developers can leverage its built-in methods and properties to enhance the behavior and appearance of custom components. This approach helps reduce redundant code and improves development efficiency.

## Supported Children
`*ALL`: Indicates that the AbstractComponent can have any kind of ZK component as its child element. This means that you can include any ZK component within the custom component that extends AbstractComponent, allowing for flexible and customizable designs. This feature provides great flexibility in designing the structure and layout of your custom components.
