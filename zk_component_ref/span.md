## Employment/Purpose

The `Span` component in ZK is a lightweight container used for grouping child components. It is typically utilized for purposes such as assigning CSS styles or creating more complex layouts within ZK applications. Conceptually, the `Span` component functions similarly to HTML's SPAN tag. Notably, content placed within a `Span` is displayed inline with other sibling elements, without introducing line breaks between them.

## Example

The example illustrates the usage of the `Span` component in a ZK application. Within the `Span` container, a label "Name:" is followed by a textbox input field.
