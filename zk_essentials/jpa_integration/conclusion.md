# Conclusion

Our book ends here. But the adventure toward ZK just begins. This book
opens you a door and introduces you some basic concepts and usages of
ZK. You can start to deploy ZK to your server according to [ZK Installation Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_installation_guide) which contains
information you will use in deploying to web servers. For further
development help, the [ ZK Developer's Reference](https://books.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Developer's_Reference) contains complete
references for various topics in developing ZK based applications (i.e.
for this chapter: [Middleware Layer/Spring]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_dev_ref/integration/spring)
or [ Persistence Layer/JPA]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_dev_ref/integration/jpa).
[ ZUML Reference ](zuml_ref/zuml) describes syntax and EL
expression used in a zul. If you want to know details of a component,
please refer to the [ ZK Component Reference](https://books.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Component_Reference "wikilink"). ZK also provides lots of
configuration, you can take a look at [ ZK Configuration Reference](https://books.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Configuration_Reference "wikilink").

We hope you can make use of what you learn here to obtain an even
greater knowledge of ZK.
