# DAO Implementation

The *Data Access Object (DAO)* pattern is a good practice to implement a
persistence layer and it encapsulates data access codes from the
business tier. A DAO object exposes an interface to a business object
and performs persistence operation relating to a particular persistent
entity. Now, we can implement persistence operations like CRUD in a DAO
class with JPA and `EntityManager` injected by Spring.

```java
@Repository
public class TodoDao {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager em;

    @Transactional(readOnly=true)
    public List<Todo> queryAll() {
        Query query = em.createQuery("SELECT t FROM Todo t");
        List<Todo> result = query.getResultList();
        return result;
    }

    ...

    @Transactional
    public Todo save(Todo todo){
        em.persist(todo);
        return todo;
    }

    @Transactional
    public Todo update(Todo todo){
        todo = em.merge(todo);
        return todo;
    }

    @Transactional
    public void delete(Todo todo){
        Todo r = get(todo.getId());
        if(r!=null){
            em.remove(r);
        }
    }
}
```

-   Line 1: We register `TodoDao` as a Spring bean with `@Repository`
    because it is a DAO class according to Spring's suggestion.
-   Line 4: As Spring manages our entity manager factory, it can
    understand `@PersistenceContext` and inject a transaction scope
    `EntityManager` for us. Hence, we don't need to create
    `EntityManager` by our own.
-   Line 7: We have enabled Spring's declarative transaction management
    so that we can apply `@Transactional` on a methods.

After completing DAO classes, we can inject them to our service class
with Spring's `@Autowired` because they are all Spring beans.

```java
@Service("todoListService")
@Scope(value="singleton",proxyMode=ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
public class TodoListServiceImpl implements TodoListService {

    @Autowired
    TodoDao dao;

    public List<Todo>getTodoList() {
        return dao.queryAll();
    }

    ...
}
```

Completing the above steps, we have created a dependency relationship
among the controller, service, and persistence classes as follows:

Each of these classes encapsulates cohesive functions and has decoupled
relationships with others. You can easily expand the architecture by
adding more classes or create dependencies between two layers.
