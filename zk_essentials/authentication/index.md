# Authentication

In this chapter, we will demonstrate how to implement authentication and
protect your pages from illegal access. We will create a login page
without a sidebar as follows:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_essentials/images/ze-ch8-login.png)

After login, we redirect users to the index page and display the user
name on the right side of the header.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_essentials/images/ze-ch8-index.png)

For third party framework integration approach to secure your application, please refer to [ZK Deverloper's Reference/integration/Security](zk_dev_ref/integration/security)
