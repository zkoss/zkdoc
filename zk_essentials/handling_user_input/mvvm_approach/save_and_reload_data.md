# Get User Input
In MVC pattern, we have to call an input component's getter (e.g. `getValue()` ) to collect user input. But in MVVM pattern, after you specify `@save`, ZK
can save user input back to a ViewModel automatically. For example in
the below zul, user input is saved automatically when you move the focus
out of the *Textbox*.

```xml
        <textbox value="@save(vm.currentUser.fullName)" .../>
```

For the property `currentUser`, we want to both save user input back to
the ViewModel and load value from the ViewModel, so the code becomes:

```xml
        <textbox value="@load(vm.currentUser.fullName)@save(vm.currentUser.fullName)" .../>
```

The syntax is quite long. ZK knows your pain and provides a shortcut syntax: `@bind`:
```xml
        <textbox value="@bind(vm.currentUser.fullName)" .../>
```

Therefore, we can save and load other `currentUser` property with `@bind` like:
```xml
...
    <rows>
        ...
        <row>
            ...
            <cell>
                <textbox value="@bind(vm.currentUser.fullName)"
                    constraint="no empty: Plean enter your full name"
                        width="200px"/>
            </cell>
        </row>
        <row>
            ...
            <cell>
                <textbox value="@bind(vm.currentUser.email)"
                constraint="/.+@.+\.[a-z]+/: Please enter an e-mail address"
                    width="200px"/>
            </cell>
        </row>
        <row>
            ...
            <cell>
                <datebox value="@bind(vm.currentUser.birthday)"
                    constraint="no future" width="200px"/>
            </cell>
        </row>
...
        <row>
            ...
            <cell>
                <textbox value="@bind(vm.currentUser.bio)"
                    multiline="true" hflex="1" height="200px" />
            </cell>
        </row>
    </rows>

...
```

# Save User Selection
Bind `selectedItem` to `vm.currentUser.country` and the selected country will be saved to `currentUser` when users select an item from the drop-down list.

```xml
<listbox model="@load(vm.countryList)" selectedItem="@bind(vm.currentUser.country)" ...>
```


# Define Commands

ViewModel also contains View's behaviors which are implemented by
methods. We call such a method "Command" of the ViewModel. These methods
usually manipulate data in the ViewModel, for example deleting an item.
The View's behaviors are usually triggered by events from the View. The
Data binding mechanism also supports binding an event to a ViewModel's
command. Firing the component's event will trigger the execution of
bound command that means invoking the corresponding command method.

For ZK to recognize a command method in a ViewModel, you should apply
annotation `@Command` to a command method. You could specify a command
name which is the method's name by default if no specified. Our example
has two behavior: "save" and "reload", so we define two command methods
for each of them:

**Define commands in a ViewModel**

```java

public class ProfileViewModel implements Serializable{
    ...

    @Command //@Command annotates a command method
    public void save(){
        currentUser = userInfoService.updateUser(currentUser);
        Clients.showNotification("Your profile is updated");
    }

    @Command
    public void reload(){
        UserCredential cre = authService.getUserCredential();
        currentUser = userInfoService.findUser(cre.getAccount());
    }
}
```

-   Line 4, 10: Annotate a method with `@Command` to make it become a
    command method, and it can be bound with data binding in a zul.
-   Line 5: Method name is the default command name if you don't specify
    in `@Command`. This method save the `currentUser` with a service
    class and show a notification.

During execution of a command, one or more properties may be changed due
to performing business or presentation logic. Developers have to specify
which property (or properties) is changed, then the data binding
mechanism can reload them to synchronize the View to the latest state.

The syntax to notify property change:

One property:

` @NotifyChange("oneProperty") `

Multiple properties:

` @NotifyChange({"property01","property02"}) `

All properties in a ViewModel:

` @NotifyChange("*") `

**Define notification & commands in a ViewModel**

```java

public class ProfileViewModel implements Serializable{
    ...

    @Command //@Command annotates a command method
    @NotifyChange("currentUser") //@NotifyChange annotates data changed notification after calling this method
    public void save(){
        currentUser = userInfoService.updateUser(currentUser);
        Clients.showNotification("Your profile is updated");
    }

    @Command
    @NotifyChange("currentUser")
    public void reload(){
        UserCredential cre = authService.getUserCredential();
        currentUser = userInfoService.findUser(cre.getAccount());
    }
}
```

-   Line 5, 12: Notify which property change with `@NotifyChange` and zK
    will reload those attributes that are bound to `currentUser`.


# Handle User Interactions by Command Binding

After we finish binding attributes to the ViewModel's data, we still
need to handle user actions, button clicking. Under the MVVM approach,
we handle events by binding an event attribute (e.g. `onClick`) to a
**Command** of a ViewModel. After we bind an event to a Command, each
time the event is sent, ZK will invoke the corresponding command method.
Hence, we should write our business logic in a command method. After
executing the command method, some properties might be changed. We
should tell ZK which properties are changed by us, then the binder will
reload them to components.

When creating the `ProfileViewModel` in the previous section, we have
defined two commands: `save` and `reload`.

Then, we can bind `onClick` event to above commands with command binding
`@command('commandName')` as follows:

```xml
...
        <hlayout>
            <button onClick="@command('save')" label="Save"/>
            <button onClick="@command('reload')" label="Reload"/>
        </hlayout>
...
```

Done with this binding, clicking each button will invoke corresponding
command methods to save (or reload) the user profile to the ViewModel.


## Keep Unsaved Input Away
Once you create a property binding with `@bind` for an input component,
ZK will save user input back to a ViewModel automatically. But sometimes
this automation is not what users want. In our example, most people
usually expect `currentUser` to change after their confirmation, e.g. clicking a button.

There is a line of text "You are editing an Anonymous's profile" at the
bottom of the form. If you change the full name to "Anonymous Somebody"
and move to next field, the line of text is changed even you don't press
the "Save" button. This could be a problem because it would mislead users,
making them think they have changed their profile, so we want to remove such behavior.

<strong>Unsaved Input Changes Data</strong>
</div>

We are going to improve this part with **form binding** feature in this
section.

Form binding automatically creates a middle object as a buffer. Before
saving to ViewModel all input data is saved to the middle object. In
this way we can keep dirty data from saving into the ViewModel before
the user confirms.

Steps to use a form binding:

1.  Give an id to middle object in `'''form'''` attribute with`@id`.

    Then you can reference the middle object in ZK bind expression with its id, e.g. `@id('fx')`.

2.  Specify ViewModel's property to be loaded with`@load`
3.  Specify ViewModel's property to save and before which Command with
   `@save`

    This means binder will save the middle object's properties to ViewModel before a command execution.

4.  Bind component's attribute to the middle object's properties like
    you do in property binding.

    You should use middle object's id specified in`@id` to reference its property, e.g. `@load(fx.account)`.

-   Line 2, 3: Define a form binding at `form` attribute and give the
    middle object's id `fx`. Specify `@load(vm.currentUser)` makes the
    binder load `currentUser`'s properties to the middle object and
    `@save(vm.currentUser, before='save')` makes the binder save middle
    object's data back to `vm.currentUser` before executing the command
    `save`.
-   Line 8, 13, 20, 27, 36, 45: We should bind attributes to middle
    object's properties to avoid altering ViewModel's properties.
-   LIne 51, 52, 53: The label bound to `vm.currentUser.fullName` is not
    affected when `fx` is changed.

After applying form binding, any user's input will not actually change
`currentUser`'s value and they are stored in the middle object until you
click the "Save" button, ZK puts the middle object's data back to the
ViewModel's properties (`currentUser`).
