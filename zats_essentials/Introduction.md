**ZK Application Test Suite** is a collection of tools which can help
users test their ZK-based application.

Currently this suite has one module:

[ZATS Mimic]({{site.baseurl}}/zats_essentials/Mimic_Library), a unit-test
library that can be used with any well-known unit test framework (e.g.
JUnit and TestNG) to test your ZUL without an application server or a
browser.
