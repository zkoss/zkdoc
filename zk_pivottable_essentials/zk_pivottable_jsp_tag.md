ZK Pivottable is also available to JSP application developers. JSP
developers can use ZK Pivottable JSP tag to include a pivottable in
their JSP pages. The JSP tag works much the same way in a JSP page as
the corresponding component tag does in a ZUL page, with support for all
the attributes and events retained.
