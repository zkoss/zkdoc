## What is ZK Pivottable

ZK Pivottable is an Ajax data summarization component, which takes raw
data from a flat table (like tables in relational database) and organize
them by desired categories arranged on columns and rows.

ZK Pivottable brings the power of spreadsheetâ€™s pivot table to Java web
applications, enabling developers to take advantage of a readymade
component for demonstrating complex sets of data online.
