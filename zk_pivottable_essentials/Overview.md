## What is ZK Pivottable

ZK Pivottable is an Ajax data summarization component, which takes raw
data from a flat table (like tables in relational database) and organize
them by desired categories arranged on columns and rows.

ZK Pivottable brings the power of spreadsheet’s pivot table to Java web
applications, enabling developers to take advantage of a readymade
component for demonstrating complex sets of data online.
