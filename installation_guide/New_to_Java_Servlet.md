You don't need to know Java Servlet to use ZK, since ZK encapsulates the
HTTP requests to higher-level concepts, such as ZUL pages and
executions. However, it is helpful if you have [some Java Servlet
concepts](http://richjava.wordpress.com/).

# Java Servlet Tutorials

A [Web container](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_container) is a
server to serve HTTP requests. A software developer who wants to add
dynamical content usually implements a so-called [Java
Servlet](http://www.google.com.tw/search?q=define:Java+Servlet).

A [Java Servlet](http://www.google.com.tw/search?q=define:Java+Servlet)
is a Java class responsible for processing HTTP requests and then
generating the corresponding HTTP response (usually in the format of
HTML), based on the requirement of your applications.

A Web container is also known as a Servlet container.
[Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) is one of the most famous Web
containers.

[Rich Java](http://richjava.wordpress.com/) offers a good tutorial about
Java Servlet.
