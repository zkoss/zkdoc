# @Command

Syntax
======
```java
@Command()

@Command("commandName")

@Command({"commandName1", "commandName2"})
```

Description
===========
**Target:** method

**Purpose:** To identify a Command method.

The optional annotation's element is a String for command's name and that name is referenced in a ZUL with event-command binding. If it's not provided, the method name is set as the command name by default.

We can also use parameter related annotations on initial method's parameters; please refer to subsections of [ Parameters](./parameters.html) for more information.

Example
=======
#### Method name as command name
```java
@Command
public void search() {
    items = new ListModelList<Item>();
    items.addAll(getSearchService().search(filter));
    selected = null;
}
```
#### Specify command name
```java
@Command("delete")
public void deleteOrder() {
    getService().delete(selected); //delete selected
    getOrders().remove(selected);
    selected = null; //clean the selected
}
```
