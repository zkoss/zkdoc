**The easiest way to deploy your application is to copy your war/ear (it
could be in an exploded format) to the autodeploy directory under the
weblogic installaton directory. If you followed the instruction above
that directory is located at
C:\bea\user_projects\domains\base_domain\autodeploy. When you place your
war/ear file in that directory, weblogic will detect it and do a hot
deployment.**

If you want to copy ZK libraries to the domain, put them under
c:/bea/user_projects/domains/base_domain/lib

Libraries that have to be copied include bsh.jar,
commons-fileupload.jar, commons-el.jar, pxcommon.jar, pxweb.jar, zk.jar,
zul.jar, and zhtml.jar.
