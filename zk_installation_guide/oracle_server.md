## 10.1.2 and earlier

Prior versions 10.1.2.0.2, 10.1.2.0.1 supports only J2EE 1.3 (with
Servlet 2.3), WEB-INF/web.xml shall be replaced with [Sample of web.xml for Servlet 2.3](ZK_Background/Sample_of_web.xml_for_Servlet_2.3).

Notice that ZK supports Servlet 2.3 but the web.xml configuration file
is a bit different. Also notice that ZK 6 and later no longer support
Java 1.4.
