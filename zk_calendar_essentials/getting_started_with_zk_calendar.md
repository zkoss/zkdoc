Here we introduce the required setup for a web application to use ZK
Calendar.

# License

ZK Calendar is GPL/Commercial dual-licensed.

# Setup by Maven

We recommend managing your project with Maven. First, you check the
available version in [ZK Maven CE repository](https://mavensync.zkoss.org/maven2/org/zkoss/calendar/calendar/).
Then, you can adopt ZK Calendar easily by simply adding a dependency
like the following example. (If you didn't setup zk maven repository
yet, you have to [ setup zk maven repository]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_installation_guide/maven_setup).)

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.zkoss.calendar</groupId>
    <artifactId>calendar</artifactId>
    <version>${calendar.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

# Manually Installing the ZK Calendar JAR

1.  [Downloaded ZK CE 7.0.3 or above](http://www.zkoss.org/download/zk.dsp)
2.  [Downloaded ZK Calendar Binary](http://www.zkoss.org/download/zkcalendar.dsp)
3.  Extract those 2 zip files, include all JAR files by putting them
    into your project's `/WEB-INF/lib`

Depending on your IDE the steps will differ, however, the most important
part is both ZK Calendar and ZKâ€™s JAR files are included in your
project's classpath. The easiest way to create a compatible project is
to use [ZK Studio](http://www.zkoss.org/download/zkstudio.dsp) and then
include calendar.jar as a library.

# A Very Basic Application

After setup, we can create an `index.zul` with the content below to
verify the setup works or not.

```xml
<zk>
    <calendars/>
</zk>
```

This gives you the very first ZK Calendar application. When a server
starts, navigate to index.zul and the following page should be
displayed.

Congratulations! That is all it takes to embed ZK Calendar within your
ZK application.
