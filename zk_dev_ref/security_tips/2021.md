# OWASP Top 10 Security Concerns In 2021

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a global nonprofit
organization dedicated to enhancing software security. Its OWASP Top 10
list serves as a crucial tool in raising awareness about web application
security, highlighting the ten most significant risks.

This page details the [OWASP Top 10 security risks for
2021](https://owasp.org/Top10/) as they pertain to the ZK framework and
offer insights into how developers can proactively address these
threats. For risks that have been listed in the 2017 list, links are
provided to the original explanations, with updates and new risks
detailed directly on this page.

# [A01:2021 - Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)

ZK Framework has strengthened its access control measures by enabling
the InaccessibleWidgetBlockService by default since 10.0.0. This service
enhances security by automatically blocking interactions with UI
components that are not meant to be accessible, such as disabled or
hidden components. This default setting helps prevent unauthorized
access and ensures that access control policies are enforced
consistently across the application.

# [A03:2021 - Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)

# [A04:2021 - Insecure Design](https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/)

ZK 10.0.0 addresses insecure design through several security
enhancements, reinforcing the framework's defense against potential
threats:

- **Stricter GET/POST Handling**: To prevent HTTP verb tampering
  attacks, ZK 10.0.0 has refined how GET and POST requests are
  processed. It now returns a 404 error if an Asynchronous Update (AU)
  request is incorrectly sent via GET, ensuring proper usage of HTTP
  methods.
- **Proactive Security Measures in CI/CD Process**: ZK 10.0.0 integrates
  three advanced security checks into our CI/CD process:
  - **Synk Scanning**: This tool analyzes both source code and
    third-party dependencies for vulnerabilities.
  - **CodeQL PR Scanning**: It assesses pull requests for Java,
    JavaScript, and TypeScript to find security flaws before they are
    merged.
  - **SonarCube**: It scans the source code comprehensively to identify
    bugs, vulnerabilities, and security risks.

# [A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)

ZK Framework has enhanced its security measures to further protect
against XML External Entities (XXE) attacks. As of ZK 10.0.0, the XML
parsing configuration has been updated to disallow Doctype declarations,
which are a common vector for XXE attacks. This change prevents the XML
parser from processing XML documents that include external entities,
thereby mitigating potential security risks. For further details, see
[ZK-5622 Disallow Doctype on parsed XML files in ZK to increase
security](https://tracker.zkoss.org/browse/ZK-5622).

ZK Framework has taken steps to enhance security configurations to
prevent common misconfigurations that could lead to security
vulnerabilities. A significant enhancement, implemented as of ZK 9.5.0,
is the [splitting of the DHtmlUpdateServlet into two dedicated
servlets](https://tracker.zkoss.org/browse/ZK-4564): one for handling
dynamic AJAX updates (AU Servlet) and another for serving static
resources (Resource Servlet). This separation enhances security by
reducing the risk of misconfigurations that could expose sensitive data
or functionality unintentionally.

# [A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)

ZK has taken proactive steps to address the risks associated with using
vulnerable and outdated components. As of ZK 9.5.0, the framework has
[integrated the OWASP Dependency Check into its build
process](https://tracker.zkoss.org/browse/ZK-4562). This tool helps
identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries
and dependencies by scanning them against known vulnerability databases.
This measure significantly enhances security by ensuring that potential
vulnerabilities are identified and addressed promptly before production
deployment.

Monitoring]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_dev_ref/security_tips/owasp_top_10_security_concerns/2017#A10-Insufficient_Logging_and_Monitoring)

# [A10:2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/)

While ZK Framework itself does not provide specific mechanisms for
making server-side requests, app developers need to ensure the safe
handling of URLs and external resources, employing strict input
validation and allowing accessible internal systems.

# Summary

Developers should understand that while a front-end framework like ZK
plays a vital role in user interface development, it represents only a
fraction of the entire application system. It's important to recognize
that vulnerabilities within the UI layer are not the primary source of
weaknesses that require fortification. Instead, developers must
comprehensively assess all layers of their applications to identify
potential vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit. With this
holistic understanding, software developers can implement proactive
measures across the entire system to mitigate these threats effectively.
