The configuration of a Web server really depends on the server itself.
There is no standard approach.

# Load Balancer (Required)

Be sure to configure [sticky session](http://wiki.metawerx.net/wiki/StickySessions) on your load
balancer because ZK only works correctly on this setting.

Check ZK DesktopImpl.java, you will see there are lots of `synchronized`
used in many methods including:

- generate desktop ID
- addPage(), removePage()
- enableServerPush()
- processing server push update

The keyword `synchronized` only works in a single JVM, so itâ€™s
impossible to keep the same state between 2 different nodes with session
replication if 2 nodes receive requests at roughly the same time.

Each AU request changes a Desktop's status of a session, if 2 AU
requests are processed by 2 different clustering nodes and each one has
its own session, then one session state might override another session.

## Session Replication vs Sticky Sessions

While sticky sessions are the recommended approach for ZK clustering, some environments require session replication for high availability. For detailed session replication setup and troubleshooting, see [Session Replication]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_dev_ref/clustering/session_replication).
