Package:
[org.zkoss.idom](http://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/idom/package-summary.html)

An implementation of W3C DOM. It is inspired by JDOM[^1] to have
concrete classes for all XML objects, such as Element and Attribute.
However, iDOM implements the W3C API, such as org.w3c.dom.Element. Thus,
you could use iDOM seamlessly with XML utilities that only accept the
W3C DOM.

A typical example is XSLT and XPath. You could use any of favorite XSL
processor and XPath utilities with iDOM.
