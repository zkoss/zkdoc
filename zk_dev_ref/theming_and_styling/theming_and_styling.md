This chapter introduces how you change a component's appearance through
different ways including mold, CSS class, or even a theme.

To customize an individual component's appearance, please read [ZK Style Customization Guide](ZK_Style_Customization_Guide).

To apply an overall, consistent design on all components, please see [ZK Developer's Reference/Theming and Styling/Creating Custom Themes]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_dev_ref/theming_and_styling/creating_custom_themes).
