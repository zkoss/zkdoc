title: "Creating Custom Themes"
---

ZK provides an extensive component set that allows web developers to use
as building blocks for easy web page UI construction. The default
styling out-of-the-box gives a look-and-feel that imitates the breeze of
the Spring season. While this may suit some perfectly, some may want to
have a complete make-over for a unique visual presentation that better
matches their sites' thematic flavor or their company's corporate style.
In ZK, switching to another 'theme' gives them a way to do just that.

In ZK's term, a **theme** is a collection of stylesheets and associated
images for all ZK components.

Please create a new custom theme according to [Theme Template](/zk_dev_ref/theming_and_styling/theme_template).

Themes could be packaged inside a folder. A new theme can be created by
first cloning the folder containing an existing theme and then making
the necessary changes to the stylesheets and images.

Prior to **6.5.1**, additional themes could only be packaged and made
available to web applications inside jar files. Sapphire and silvertail
are the two official examples.

Please refer to the subsections according to ZK version you use.
