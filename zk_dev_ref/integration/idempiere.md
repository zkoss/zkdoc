In the following sections, we describe how ZK integrates with iDempiere, an open-source ERP platform that uses ZK Community Edition (CE) as its default UI framework. These sections explain how iDempiere users can upgrade from ZK CE to ZK EE and how to integrate additional ZK add-on components, such as ZK Charts and Keikai Spreadsheet, into an iDempiere application.

Since iDempiere is built on an OSGi-based plugin and fragment architecture, the integration and upgrade process differs from that of a standard ZK application. The documentation therefore focuses on the required plugins, configuration steps, and common considerations when extending ZK functionality within the iDempiere environment.
