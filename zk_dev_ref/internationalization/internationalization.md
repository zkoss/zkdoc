title: "Internationalization"
---

This chapter describes how to make ZK applications flexible enough to
run in any locale.

First of all, ZK enables developers to embed Java code and EL
expressions any way you like. You could use any Internationalization
method you want, such as java.util.ResourceBundle.

However, ZK has some built-in support of internationalization that you
might find them useful.
