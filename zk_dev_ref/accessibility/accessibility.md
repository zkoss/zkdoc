# Overview - Achieve AA Compliance

According to
[W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/), web
accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed
and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. This also
benefits people without disabilities, for example, people with temporary
disabilities (e.g. injured) or people who have situational limitations
under particular circumstances (e.g. no mouse access).

The za11y (zk-accessibility) module enables you to create accessible
[WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20) **AA (Double-A)-compliant**
applications. Key features include full keyboard support, assistive
technologies support, and high-contrast themes.

To meet accessibility requirements, one key point is to provide semantic
information about widgets, structures, and behaviors for assistive
technologies. With the za11y module, ZK widgets will render such
semantic information based on their purposes according to
[WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/). However, depending on an
applicationâ€™s context, a widget might play different roles in different
pages and this has to be designed by application developers --
developers should fully understand the purposes, requirements, and
expectations to deliver complete accessibility.

This chapter shares with you what the ZK framework has done in terms of
accessibility in general, and how you can specify additional
application-specific accessible information. For the details of each
component, please refer to [ZK Component Reference/Accessibility]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_component_ref/accessibility).

# Enable Accessibility Support

ZK accessibility module is a separate, optional jar, you have to include
it manually to enable it.

```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.zkoss.zk</groupId>
            <artifactId>za11y</artifactId>
            <version>${zk.version}</version>
        </dependency>
```

To ensure za11y.jar is running as expected at run-time, you can simply
inspect a textbox. If you see ARIA attributes rendered in its DOM
elements, that means the module works successfully. Please see [Built-in Support](#Built-in_Support).

We use axe DevTools 3.5.3 in ZK 9.5.0 to check the WCAG rules in za11y.
We use Lighthouse 11.4.0 in ZK 10.0.0 to check the WCAG rules in za11y.

# Built-in Support

To know what default ARIA attributes are rendered by ZK, please open the
developer tool to inspect the widget.

**textbox.zul**

```xml
<textbox />
```

Visit the zul page and inspect the textbox with a browser developer
tool, you will see some aria attributes rendered:

```html
<input id="h5AP0" class="z-textbox" type="text" 
       aria-disabled="false" aria-readonly="false">
```

Some components render special ARIA attributes, please refer to [ZK Component Reference/Accessibility]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_component_ref/accessibility).

# Specify ARIA Attributes

You can specify arbitrary ARIA attribute as needed on a component with
[namespace "client/attribute"](https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZUML_Reference/ZUML/Namespaces/Client_Attribute)
like:

```xml
<zk  xmlns:ca="client/attribute">
    <div ca:aria-hidden="true"/>
    <textbox ca:aria-label="${field}"/>
    <intbox ca:aria-labelledby="${price}"/>
</zk>
```

# Label with an Input Component

There are 3 ways to associate an input component with a label:

## Enclose with a label

```xml
<zk xmlns:h="native" xmlns:ca="client/attribute">
    <h:label>Address
        <textbox/>
    </h:label>
```

## Specify at aria-label

```xml
<zk xmlns:h="native" xmlns:ca="client/attribute">
    <custom-attributes field="Account:"/>
    ${field}
    <textbox ca:aria-label="${field}"/>
```

## Specify at aria-labelledby

```xml
<zk xmlns:h="native" xmlns:ca="client/attribute">
    <label value="price" id="priceLabel"/>
    <textbox ca:aria-labelledby="${priceLabel.uuid}"/>
```

# Demo Application

This demo application shows how you can build a ZK-based application
with za11y module support. It also demonstrates key accessible features
such as high contrast themes, keyboard support, screen reader support,
mouse/touch support, landmarks and so on.

# Screen Reader

During the development, we have tested the accessibility with the
following screen readers:

## JAW

- proprietary, Windows
- Toggle Virtual PC Cursor: `Insert + Z` or `NumberPad +`
- [Guide](https://www.freedomscientific.com/training/jaws/)
- [Issues](https://github.com/FreedomScientific/VFO-standards-support/issues)

## NVDA

- Toggle browse/focus mode: Insert + Spacebar

## VoiceOver

- Mac built-in, activate by `Command + F5`
- [using VoiceOver to browse and navigate webpages](https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/_1134.html)

## [Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1)

- Windows 10 built-in
- start/stop narrator: `windows + ctrl + enter`
- switch scan mode: `narrator(CapsLock) + space`
