title: "Keyboard Support"
---

You can operate ZK components using only a keyboard, e.g. press TAB to
move the focus and navigate. For keyboard support details of each
component, please refer to [ZK Component Reference/Accessibility]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_component_ref/accessibility/accessibility).

To implement your own key handling, please see [ZK Developer's Reference/UI Patterns/Keystroke Handling]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_dev_ref/ui_patterns/keystroke_handling)
