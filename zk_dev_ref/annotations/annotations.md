title: "Annotations"
---

An annotation is a special form of syntactic metadata that can be added
to components. The definitions, properties and components themselves may
be annotated. The annotations can be retrieved at the run time.

The annotations have no direct effect on the operation of the
components. Rather, they are mainly used for UI designers to annotate
metadata, such that it controls how a tool or a utility shall do at
run-time. The content and meanings of annotations totally depend on the
tools or the utilities the developer uses. For example, [ZK Bind]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_mvvm_ref/data_binding/index) examines
annotations to know how to load and store the value of a component.
