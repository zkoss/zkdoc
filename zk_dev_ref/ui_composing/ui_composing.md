Each UI object is represented by a component
(<javadoc type="interface">org.zkoss.zk.ui.Component</javadoc>). In this
section we will discuss how to declare UI, including [XML-based approach]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_dev_ref/ui_composing/zuml) and
[pure-Java approach]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_dev_ref/ui_composing/richlet).

This section describes more general and overall concepts of UI
composing. For more detailed and specific topics, please refer to the
[UI Patterns]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_dev_ref/ui_patterns) section.
For detailed information on each individual component, please refer to
the [ZK Component Reference](ZK_Component_Reference).
