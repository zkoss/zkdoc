# Apply (Recommended)

We suggest using
[<apply>](http://books.zkoss.org/zk-mvvm-book/8.0/shadow_elements/shadow_elements.html)
instead of `Include`. Because comparing to `Include`, it has several
advantages:

1.  Doesn't consume extra memory.
      
    Because it's a shadow element, it doesn't create a corresponding
    component at the server side.
2.  Doesn't render an extra `<div>` surrounding its child components at
    the client-side.
      
    `Include` renders a `<div>` to enclose its child components.
    Sometimes the outer `<div>` breaks the layout.
3.  Doesn't create an ID space.
      
    `Include` itself is an ID space owner which affects you when
    locating a component with ZK selector syntax.
4.  It can render its child components upon parameters dynamically.
      
    You can pass a parameter with data binding and bind to the
    parameter. When the parameter's value changes, the content will
    change accordingly.

# Include

[Include]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_component_ref/essential_components/include)
allows you to include a zul page, an HTML, zhtml, JSP page, or a URL
mapped to a servlet. For example,

```xml
<include src="another.zul"/>
<include src="another.jsp"/>
```

When including a ZUML page, the components specified in the ZUML page
will become the child components of the
[org.zkoss.zul.Include](https://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/zul/Include.html) component.

For example, suppose we have two ZUL pages as follows:

```xml
<!-- first.zul -->
<include src="second.zul"/>
```

and

```xml
<!-- second.zul -->
<listbox>
    <listitem label="foo"/>
</listbox>
```

Then, `listbox` in `second.zul` will become the child of `include` in
`first.zul`.

When including a non-ZUML page (such as JSP), the output of the page
will be the content of the [org.zkoss.zul.Include](https://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/zul/Include.html)
component. Thus, the output must be a valid HTML fragment without <code>

<html>

,

<head>

,

<body>

</code>.

If you prefer to create an independent page
([org.zkoss.zk.ui.Page](https://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/zk/ui/Page.html)), or want to
include a page rendered by `Richlet` while the value of src ends with
`.zul` or `.zhtml`, you could specify the mode with `defer`
(<javadoc method="setMode(java.lang.String)">org.zkoss.zul.Include</javadoc>).
Then, `include` won't have any child. Rather, an instance of
[org.zkoss.zk.ui.Page](https://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/zk/ui/Page.html) will be created
to hold the content of `second.zul` or the content generated by Richlet.

# Classpath Web Resource Path

ZK provides a special path URL starting with **`~./`**, it looks for a
file under a folder starting with **`web`** in a web application's
classpath, e.g.

- `my-module.jar/web/`.
- WEB-INF/classes/web

So it will get a file under the path among all included jars. You can
specify such URL in a component path-related attribute like:

```xml
<?component name="another" templateURI="~./another.zul" ?>
<zk>
    <vlayout>
        apply templateURI:
        <apply templateURI="~./another.zul" />

        component directive:
        <another/>
        
        image src:
        <image src="~./zklogo.png" />
    </vlayout>
</zk>
```

## Modular Resource Sharing

The `~./` path simplifies sharing resources across projects. For example, when creating a sub-module project, you can store reusable assets such as CSS files, images, JavaScript, or ZUL templates in this path. By packaging the sub-module as a JAR and including it in your main project, the main project can easily access these resources using the `~./` path.

This approach makes it convenient to manage and reuse static resources without duplicating files across projects. However, since files under the `~./` path are publicly accessible, avoid placing sensitive or confidential data in these folders.

# Application-wide Named <Apply>

If you prefer an application-wide named
[<apply>](http://books.zkoss.org/zk-mvvm-book/8.0/syntax/apply.html)
element with a predefined templateURI and default parameters, you could
specify it in [a language addon]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_client_side_ref/language_definition). For
example, we could prepare a file called `WEB-INF/lang-addon.xml` with
the following content:

```xml
<language-addon>
    <addon-name>myapp</addon-name>
    <language-name>xul/html</language-name>
    <component>
        <component-name>mytemplatecomp</component-name>
        <template-uri>~./template/mytemplate.zul</template-uri>
    </component>
</language-addon>
```

Next, we could specify this file by adding the following content to
`WEB-INF/zk.xml`:

```xml
    <language-config>
        <addon-uri>/WEB-INF/lang-addon.xml</addon-uri>
    </language-config>
```

Then, we can use it with a custom tag name:

```xml
<mytemplatecomp>
```
