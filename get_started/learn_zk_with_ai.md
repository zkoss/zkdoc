# Interactive Learning Roadmap

To make the most of your AI learning companion, we recommend a structured approach. Below is a four-phase learning roadmap with suggested prompts for each stage.

## Phase 1: ZUL and UI Basics

Start by understanding how ZK builds user interfaces without JavaScript.

**Suggested prompts:**
- "How do I create a simple form layout in ZUL?"
- "Explain the relationship between ZUL components and Java objects"
- "What are the most commonly used layout containers?"
- "Show me how to style components using sclass"

**Key concepts to explore:**
- ZUL markup syntax and component hierarchy
- Layout containers (vlayout, hlayout, borderlayout)
- Component properties and attributes
- Basic styling approaches

## Phase 2: MVC vs MVVM Patterns

Understand ZK's two primary architectural patterns and when to use each.

**Suggested prompts:**
- "Compare MVC and MVVM patterns in ZK based on the documentation"
- "Which pattern should I choose MVVM over MVC?"
- "How does data binding work in MVVM?"
- "Explain the @Wire and @Listen annotations in MVC"

**Key concepts to explore:**
- SelectorComposer and component wiring
- ViewModel and data binding expressions
- Event handling in both patterns
- Separation of concerns

## Phase 3: Working with Components

Dive deeper into ZK's rich component library.

**Suggested prompts:**
- "How do I implement a sortable Grid with pagination?"
- "What options are available for data-driven Listbox?"
- "How do I handle selection events in Grid?"
- "Explain the difference between ListModel and render on-demand"

**Key concepts to explore:**
- Data components (Grid, Listbox, Tree)
- Input components and validation
- Navigation components
- Modal dialogs and popups

## Phase 4: Enterprise Integration

Learn how ZK fits into enterprise Java ecosystems.

**Suggested prompts:**
- "What are the best practices for Spring Boot integration?"
- "How do I use Spring beans in my ZK controllers?"
- "Explain the @WireVariable annotation"
- "How does ZK handle database transactions?"

**Key concepts to explore:**
- Spring Framework integration
- Dependency injection in ZK
- JPA/Hibernate integration patterns
- Security integration

# Tips for Effective AI-Assisted Learning

## Ask Specific Questions

Instead of broad questions like "How does ZK work?", ask targeted questions:
- "How do I pass data from a parent component to a child component?"
- "What happens when I click a button in ZK's architecture?"

## Request Comparisons

NotebookLM excels at comparing concepts from your sources:
- "Compare how MVC and MVVM handle form validation"
- "What are the differences between include and apply in ZUL?"

## Ask for Code Examples

When you need practical guidance:
- "Show me an example of a ViewModel with command binding"
- "Give me a ZUL template for a master-detail layout"

## Verify with Official Documentation

While NotebookLM provides accurate answers based on your sources, always verify critical implementation details against the official documentation for the latest information.
