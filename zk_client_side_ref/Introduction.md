ZK Client-side Reference is the reference for client-side programming,
including component development.

Client-side programming is optional for application developers. However,
if you'd like to have more control of the client, please refer to the
[General Control]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_client_side_ref/general_control)
and [Customization]({{site.baseurl}}/zk_client_side_ref/customization)
sections. The other sections are more for component development.

If you would like to develop a component, you should read [ZK Component
Development Essentials](ZK_Component_Development_Essentials)
first for the introduction. Then, you could reference this book if there
is an issue.
