title: "New to JavaScript"
---

This section is a quick starting guide for Java Programmers to have
quick understanding of JavaScript. You could skip this section if you're
already familiar with JavaScript. For a complete list of ZK client-side
API, please refer to [JavaScript API](http://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/jsdoc/). For jQuery API, please
refer to [jQuery's documentation](http://docs.jquery.com/).

Here we only discuss Javascript. Javascript is actually easy for Java
programmers to learn. The real challenge is the manipulation of DOM and
the knowledge of CSS. If you're not familiar with them, please refer to
[JavaScript Tutorial in w3cschools](http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp).
