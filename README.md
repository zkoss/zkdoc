# Apply Jekyll Remote Theme

Jekyll plugin for building Jekyll sites with any public GitHub-hosted theme


## Usage

1. Add the following to your Gemfile

  ```ruby
  gem "jekyll-remote-theme"
  ```

  and run `bundle install` to install the plugin

2. Add the following to your site's `_config.yml` to activate the plugin

  ```yml
  plugins:
    - jekyll-remote-theme
  ```
  Note: If you are using a Jekyll version less than 3.5.0, use the `gems` key instead of `plugins`.

3. Add the following to your site's `_config.yml` to choose your theme

  ```yml
  remote_theme: benbalter/retlab
  ```

## Declaring your theme

Remote themes are specified by the `remote_theme` key in the site's config.

Remote themes must be in the form of `OWNER/REPOSITORY`, and must represent a public GitHub-hosted Jekyll theme. See [the Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) for more information on authoring a theme. Note that you do not need to upload the gem to RubyGems or include a `.gemspec` file.

You may also optionally specify a branch, tag, or commit to use by appending an `@` and the Git ref (e.g., `benbalter/retlab@v1.0.0` or `benbalter/retlab@develop`). If you don't specify a Git ref, the `master` branch will be used.
